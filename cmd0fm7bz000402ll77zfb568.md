Starting something new in tech can feel overwhelming—especially with how broad DevOps is. But thanks to the right guidance and community, I’ve been able to create a structured plan that actually works for me.

Here’s how I’m approaching my DevOps journey.

## Following a Solid Mentor: Mischa van den Burg & KubeCraft

Right now, I’m following the guidance of **Mischa van den Burg** and his incredible community: **KubeCraft**.

What I appreciate about Mischa’s approach:

* He breaks down complex topics into simple, digestible steps
    
* He connects theory with practical application
    
* He focuses on *why* tools matter—not just *how* to use them
    

Even more valuable than the videos is the **community aspect** of KubeCraft. Being part of a group of learners and practitioners helps me stay motivated, get support, and share what I’m building.

If you’re looking for a grounded way to start learning Kubernetes and DevOps, I highly recommend checking out KubeCraft.

## Supplementing with YouTube & Real-World Content

I also supplement with YouTube videos—usually ones that walk through:

* Real infrastructure deployments
    
* GitOps workflows
    
* CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, or Jenkins
    
* Helm, Kustomize, and YAML
    

There’s a lot of noise out there, so I try to stick with creators who:

* Explain clearly
    
* Don’t overhype tools
    
* Share *why* decisions are made in real-world setups
    

**Open question for you:**

> Who’s your go-to DevOps creator or mentor online? I’d love to check out more great educators.

## Stay Curious, Stay Consistent

This journey isn’t about rushing to “master DevOps.”  
It’s about understanding the ecosystem, building intuition, and growing through real-world hands-on experience.

If you’re on a similar journey, I’d love to hear how you’re approaching it.  
And if you’ve got any must-follow creators, teachers, or blogs—drop them in the comments or message me.

Let’s learn and build together.
