Over the past few weeks, I’ve been spending more time in my homelab, and I recently got **k3s up and running**.

If you’re not familiar, k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution created by Rancher. It’s designed to be resource-efficient and simple to set up, which makes it perfect for learning and experimenting in a homelab.

## Why k3s?

Here are a few reasons I chose k3s over a full Kubernetes distribution:

1. **Lightweight** – Runs smoothly on limited hardware.
    
2. **Fast installation** – One command and you’re up and running.
    
3. **Perfect for practice** – Lets you learn Kubernetes concepts without needing a full enterprise cluster.
    

## What’s Next

Now that I have my cluster running, my next steps will include:

✅ Deploying real workloads.  
✅ Experimenting with Helm charts.  
✅ Practicing cluster management and troubleshooting.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re new to Kubernetes and want to start experimenting at home, I can’t recommend k3s enough. It provides a great balance of simplicity and functionality, especially if you don’t have enterprise-grade hardware at your disposal.
