I’ve officially kicked off my DevOps and Kubernetes journey—and for me, there’s no better way to learn than by building it out in my own home lab.

I’ve had a homelab setup for years now, mostly focused on general IT, networking, and automation. But this is the first time I’m intentionally designing it with DevOps and Kubernetes in mind.

## 🖥️ The Hardware

I recently picked up five **HP EliteDesk 800 G4 Mini PCs**. Each one is powered by an **Intel i5-8500T** and comes with **16GB of RAM**—solid specs for the kind of small-scale, high-availability cluster I want to build.

### My goal?

To create a functional **HA Kubernetes cluster** that lets me explore:

* Core Kubernetes architecture
    
* Cluster scaling and self-healing
    
* CI/CD integration
    
* Monitoring, logging, and GitOps workflows
    

I’ll be learning everything hands-on—from kubectl bootstrapping to breaking (and fixing) things intentionally. Because I believe the best way to truly understand how something works… is to build it, break it, and rebuild it again.

## 🤔 What About You?

If you’ve ever set up a homelab—or thought about it—I’d love to hear about your setup.

* What gear are you using?
    
* What are your current goals?
    
* Are you exploring Kubernetes, too?
